# Issues

## All Platforms

- Look into setting `MOZ_DISTRIBUTION_ID` to "com.teracet" and the effects of that

## Windows

Nothing.

## Mac

- Look into setting `MOZ_MACBUNDLE_ID` and `MOZ_MACBUNDLE_NAME` to change the installed app from "SQLiteComposer.app" to "SQLite Composer.app" (first try: `MOZ_MACBUNDLE_NAME` doesn't appear to have any effect)

## Linux

Nothing.
